        update linuxmint-keyring
        consider enabling recommends

        terminal:
            [Fixed in git] terminal makes sounds
            Shift+Ctrl+T to open a new tab... should be Ctrl+T
            no transparency?

            mint-backgrounds-sarah

        cinnamon screensaver:
            https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/5150#issuecomment-215728443

        Mint apps:
            gtk3:
                mintinstall
                mintsources
                mintupload
           hidpi:
                mintwelcome uses 32px png icons
                mintlocale uses fixed-size flag icons
                mintupdate uses fixed-size icons
            mintupdate:
                thicken numbers in status icons
            mintupload:
                use icon names rather than path to SVG
            mintinstall:
                add sarah to community, export pkg list to server-side infra
            mintsources:
                https://github.com/linuxmint/mintsources/issues/59
            mintinstall:
                when apt cache is missing, it just says not available. Instead it could tell the user or even help the user to refresh the cache.
            mintmenu:
                dark themes https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/87
                https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/149
                https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/145
                prefs don't open?
            use aptdaemon?
                aptdaemon doesn't work in LMDE and is being abandoned upstream
                in mintupdate, remove dep on synaptic, remove admin rights for checkAPT.py
                in mintwelcome and codec menu entry, switch from apturl to aptdaemon
                in mintsources, remove dep on synaptic
                remove synaptic from default selection
                remove synaptic from mintmenu's favorites
            update mint-translations

        Software selection:
            consider replacing/removing mintbackup
            consider replacing/removing gthumb

		System:
			add "pwfeedback" to Defaults line in sudoers file, to show *** feedback when typing password
            Upgrade path from Mint 17.3

        mdm:
            don't let people type their username without clicking something
            Logitech keyboards support https://github.com/linuxmint/mdm/issues/5

		cinnamon 3.0:
            nemo: restore the ability to select files on the desktop by typing their name
			multi-monitor: add an option to suspend on lid-close EVEN when external monitors are plugged
			sound: add an option to switch sound to HDMI when an HDMI output device is plugged
			menu: search on non-accentuated versions (for instance, "method" should find mintlocale's im in French)
			hidpi issues: top of mint menu is cut off in HiDPI (1920Ã—1280)
			gnome-system-monitor moves out of place in Expo
			when battery is very low, battery icon isn't red.. 2% charge, with less than 5 minutes to go, still not red.. bar is red in CCC, icon is red in notification.. but not in applet (and also not in the CCC icon itself either)
			When using Cinnamon bar at top, and secondary monitor with higher height than the main display, some apps like KDE Apps (Krita, Kdenlive) or Wine Based Apps (teamviewer) will display menus from toolbar in the wrong place. Being more specific: The menus will be displayed in the position that they should be displayed at main monitor, however in this case the window is maximized in the secondary monitor.
			hovering over notifications which have buttons/widgets should not dim them ...
			accessibility: ability to select files by hovering them
            menu: use search providers to search local files


		gthumb tries to launch gnome-control-center when applying a background

		hexchat: add notifications, hide in/out messages, by default


Maintenance
===========

	cinnamon-spices website:
        reimplement css
		handle utf-8, see comments on http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/applets/view/171

    community website:
        people are led to believe the community website is the place for support. place an info message in the sidebar (or headerbar), and on the registration page to explain the forums are the place to be.

Linux Mint 18.1
===============

    system
        consider adding snapd

    cinnamon 3.2
        vertical panels
        retire boxpointers
        remove plug/socket in screensaver
        applets
            menu: adopt this layout (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Panacea-Projects/Gnomenu/master/Screenshot.png), same as ours/mintmenu, only better.
            add a printer applet

    mate 1.16
        swith MATE to GTK3
        switch mintmenu to GTK3
        sound events vs sound themes
        multi-monitor: caja doesn't always show the desktop on the primary monitor (using a laptop as main/left monitor, and HDMI screen with higher res on the right, it surprisingly ends up showing icons on the right screen)

    libindicator++?

    xed
        sublime-like search bar

    mintupdate:
        provide a CLI (to let people upgrade automatically)
        fix mergelist issues directly in mintupdate or checkAPT

LMDE +1:
=========

    bashrc: # colored GCC warnings and errors --> export GCC_COLORS='error=01;31:warning=01;35:note=01;36:caret=01;32:locus=01:quote=01' (won't work until gcc 4.9)
    update grub (improves efi support)
    history and completion in bashrc
    install libhal1-flash by default
    consider activating http://backports.debian.org/changes/jessie-backports.html
