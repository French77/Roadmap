	Linux Mint 18 Sarah
	===================

        Look and feel:
            isolinux theme
            plymouth theme
            new GTK theme
            new icon theme
            consider making it easy to switch to old theme? (maybe a meta-theme and support for it in cinnamon?).
            website revamp

        X-Apps:
            [done] xed
            [done] xplayer
            [done] xviewer
            [done] xreader
            xar
            xapps support in Cinnamon
            xapps support in MATE
            xapps support in MIME defaults

        Regressions:
            GTK/Nemo: text entry out of place when renaming a file
            GTK: Overlay scrollbars hide content (for instance the last line of text in a text editor when wrapping is disabled)
            GTK: Pathbar buttons (visible in nemo)

        Mint apps:
            gtk3:
                [done] mintdesktop
                [done] mintsystem
                [done] mintwelcome
                [done] mintlocale
                [done] mintdrivers
                [done] mintnanny
                [done] mintstick
                [done] mint-common
                [done] mintupdate
                mintbackup
                mintinstall
                mintsources
                mintupload
           hidpi:
                mintwelcome uses 32px png icons
                mintlocale uses fixed-size flag icons
                mintupdate uses fixed-size icons
            Full black-box testing on xenial:
                mintdesktop
                mintsystem
                mintwelcome
                mintinstall
                mintmenu
                mintsources
                mintstick
                mintupdate
                mintupload
                mintbackup
                mintdrivers
                mintlocale
                mintnanny

        Software selection:
            consider replacing/removing mintbackup
            consider replacing/removing gthumb

		System:
			Restore brightness settings on reboot (killswitch does that for bluetooth state)
			add "pwfeedback" to Defaults line in sudoers file, to show *** feedback when typing password
            Upgrade path from Mint 17.3
            Don't disable ipv6 in Firefox
            check that libdvdcss2 is no longer needed (test encrypted DVD playback, consider libdvd-pkg, or postinst installation from libdvdread4)
            move extra pkgs to import
            remove adobe-flashplugin from the repos (was put there temporarily as Ubuntu xenial partner repo doesn't have it yet)
            update live grub
            update ubuntu-drivers-common (possibly nvidia-prime)
            mdm: don't let people type their username without clicking something
            mintsources: https://github.com/linuxmint/mintsources/issues/59
            meta: update fonts deps to fonts-dejavu, fonts-dejavu-extra, fonts-wqy-microhei.
            mint-meta-mate: 1) no need to depend on gir1.2-mate-menu, it's not used anywhere and is half-broken; 2) need to drop mate-netspeed for mint 18 as this package is merged into mate-applets in 1.14 release.

		mate 1.14:
			touchpad: tap actions should reflect click actions
			mcc: replace sound themes with sound events
			multi-monitor: caja doesn't always show the desktop on the primary monitor (using a laptop as main/left monitor, and HDMI screen with higher res on the right, it surprisingly ends up showing icons on the right screen)

		cinnamon 3.0:
            nemo: restore the ability to select files on the desktop by typing their name
            provide cinnamon-desktop-environment and cinnamon-core metapackages
			touchpad: tap actions should reflect click actions
			multi-monitor: add an option to suspend on lid-close EVEN when external monitors are plugged
			sound: add an option to switch sound to HDMI when an HDMI output device is plugged
			menu: search on non-accentuated versions (for instance, "method" should find mintlocale's im in French)
			hidpi issues: top of mint menu is cut off in HiDPI (1920Ã—1280)
			gnome-system-monitor moves out of place in Expo
			when battery is very low, battery icon isn't red.. 2% charge, with less than 5 minutes to go, still not red.. bar is red in CCC, icon is red in notification.. but not in applet (and also not in the CCC icon itself either)
			When using Cinnamon bar at top, and secondary monitor with higher height than the main display, some apps like KDE Apps (Krita, Kdenlive) or Wine Based Apps (teamviewer) will display menus from toolbar in the wrong place. Being more specific: The menus will be displayed in the position that they should be displayed at main monitor, however in this case the window is maximized in the secondary monitor.
			hovering over notifications which have buttons/widgets should not dim them ...
			accessibility: ability to select files by hovering them
            menu: use search providers to search local files

		mintupdate:
			unattended updates? at least provide a CLI to do it via cron?
			fix mergelist issues directly in mintupdate or checkAPT

		mintinstall: when apt cache is missing, it just says not available. Instead it could tell the user or even help the user to refresh the cache.
		mintmenu: dark themes https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/87
        mintsystem: review /usr/bin/apt and add missing features (list, search etc..)

        mintmenu: https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/149
        mintmenu: https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/145

		people are led to believe the community website is the place for support:
			change the order in FF bookmarks -> place Community at the end, after Forums/Blog.
			place an info message in the sidebar (or headerbar), and on the registration page to explain the forums are the place to be.

		gthumb tries to launch gnome-control-center when applying a background

		hexchat: add notifications, hide in/out messages, by default

        Ready:
            mintsources: add-apt-repository now supports --remove
