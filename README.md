Linux Mint 19
=============

need_update:
  - minecraft-installer
  - whatsapp-desktop
  - spotify-client
  - dropbox
  - google-earth-pro-stable
  - skypeforlinux

artwork:
  - grey-on-grey icons (many in cinnamon-settings)
  - improve status icons: nm-signal-, volume-audio-, power icons
  - xfce has two notifs when changing volume and one is missing an icon
  - remove humanity-icon-theme and ubuntu-mono
  - mintwelcome icon
  - .deb icon
  - mint-x: visual glitches in mate-screensaver-preferences in the left pane (list of screensavers). Just move the mouse over that pane back and forth, without clicking. Doesn't happen with Mint-Y.

mate:
  - hide compton menuitem
  - mintlocale im has no window icon
  - mintlocale has no window icon
  - hidpi:
    - blurry titlebar buttons
    - grey tooltips

- cinnamon fallback -> muffin_no_shadows=1
- ia32-libs: depends on libesd0:i386 which is gone
- csd-power: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-settings-daemon/issues/209
- blueberry won't launch in VM (Xfce): "bt-adapter -i" hangs and then segfaults
- xfce: remove xfburn
- intel-microcode is missing https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-drivers-common/+bug/1758689
- gist-paste still used in xapps/mintsystem
- update translations
- update installation guide translations

release upgrade tool:
  - migrate to pkexec
  - make sure timeshift config is in place
  - make sure mdm isn't in use anymore
  - suggestions:
    - Re-enable 3rd party repositories after upgrade. A backup of the APT sources gets stored in ./Upgrade-Backup/APT but the tutorial didn't cover this or what to do with it (probably best to just find what the 3rd party repositories were and re-enable them manually from instructions on their website). Important for things like Google Chrome.
    - mintupgrade replaces user modified configuration files in /etc without prompting, leaving .dpkg-old files behind. Perhaps cover this tidbit in the tutorial.

LMDE 3

backports:
  - flatpak/ostree/appstream?

    mintupdate:
        safeguard against package removals (for instance, don't let users perform updates which would remove sensitive packages).
        notice to reboot the computer when appropriate
        purge old kernels? https://github.com/Pjotr123/purge-old-kernels-2
        systray icon or infobar to notify user of new Mint versions
        remember sorting of updates

    port mintstick to python3

    mintreport:
        detect missing l10n packages and hint at mintlocale
        warn about root password if not set

    artwork
        add dark variant support to Mint-Y (needs fixes in Caja)
        mint-y lack of borders without compositing
        gtk color variations

        marco: add support for GTK dark variants

    system
        plymouth: center text, hide "None" value

    slick
        would be nice to show release number

    xapps/cinnamon/nemo:
        don't ship icons with generic names in /usr/share/hicolor. All icons should be prefixed (cs-, xapp-, nemo-..etc..) so they don't conflict with other packages

Roadmap
=======

    desktop-search:
        local files
        web engines
        recent
        apps
        dictionary
        translations

    mate:
        switch mozo for menulibre

    mintreport:
        dmesg errors
        foreign packages if pinned by mint
        wrong lsb info..etc.
        slow boot sequence
        slow shutdown sequence

    implement an alarm clock

    cinnamon:
        CSD/Cinnamon should set GtkSettings' gtk-print-preview-command to "xreader-previewer -u -p %s %f" (test by launching xreader from terminal, ask for a print preview and see error trying to launch evince on stdout)
        cinnamon slow to start after boot --> delay execution of appsys/docinfo until the DE is loaded
        CSD: support mouse wheel speed? Evdev scrolling distance?
        menu keywords: looking for display in menu shows color first
        preferences > keyboard > custom shortcuts. Used with a Spanish keyboard layout. Recorded: crtl+number and ctrl+Shift+number (e.g. ctrl+1 and ctrl+shift+1 = ctrl+!) they are recorded correctly. When using the shortcut the command defined in the shift combination is triggered with just ctrl+number (i.e. ctrl+1). The complete combination triggers nothing (i.e. ctrl+shift+1 does nothing) and the comand defined in ctrl+number can never be used. This worked in 17.3.
        track/troubleshoot shutdown sequence (user should know what is happening when shutdown isn't immediate)
        track/troubleshoot vsync, compositing, unredirected windows and policy
        menu: consider adopting this layout (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Panacea-Projects/Gnomenu/master/Screenshot.png), same as ours/mintmenu, only better.
        todo list applet/desklet
        calendar events applet/desklet
        multiple clocks https://github.com/simonwiles/cinnamon_applets
        network applet: airplane mode (quick way to rfkill all)
        nemo: retire computer:/// place (which is completely useless) or revamp it into something better
        alt-tab and panel use icon provided by appsys, ignoring icon set by the application itself (example: a python window using widow.set_icon_name())
        actions in panel launchers aren't translated if not present in .desktop file
        gnome-system-monitor moves out of place in Expo
        When using Cinnamon bar at top, and secondary monitor with higher height than the main display, some apps like KDE Apps (Krita, Kdenlive) or Wine Based Apps (teamviewer) will display menus from toolbar in the wrong place. Being more specific: The menus will be displayed in the position that they should be displayed at main monitor, however in this case the window is maximized in the secondary monitor.
        Is there any reason why there are two names for the same item, eg. "Trash" and "Rubbish Bin"? Would it be better to standardise on only one name?
        add gnome-screenshot to panel, right-click and select "Take screenshot of a selected area". This runs gnome-screenshot -a.. it should work but it doesn't. Is it because of the panel launcher capturing the click event or something?

    make the GOA frontend an Xapp (it should be cross-DE), disable buggy/irrelevant services

    xapps
        implement an app-sharing protocol to quickly move a document from one app to another

        gestures support:
            pinch:
                zoom document in pix
                zoom view in nemo

            swipe:
                previous/next document in pix

            scroll:
                sound-volume/seek in xplayer

            click:
                pause/resume in xplayer

            double-click:
                full-screen in xplayer
                full-screen in xviewer

        pix
            doesn't rotate videos when playing them
            vignettes should look better, and the same in all themes
            support prefer-dark-themes
            treeview in sidebar shows unecessary "(empty)" when dirs have no subdirs

        xreader
            xreader-previewer use full-color icons

    artwork:
        Tray icons are black with mint-y themes.
        mint-x-icons: network status icons have a dark background in panel 33px and bigger (sound icon looks wrong in 41px and bigger).
        mint-y The maximize/restore window control button doesnâ€™t change visually between in maximized and restored state (default theme and Mint-Y-Dark)

    system:
        compiler optimization: consider optimizing compiled binaries for Cinnamon/Xapps

    HiDPI support:
        upstream apps using GTK2: Gimp, Hexchat, Tomboy.
