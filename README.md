Cinnamon 3.6
============

    cinnamon:
        cinnamon slow to start after boot --> delay execution of appsys/docinfo until the DE is loaded
        reconsider inhibiting onscreen keyboards (our keyboard doesn't do locales layouts and it's quite ugly)

    nemo:
        Skip GVFS when possible
        ability to search string within files and open xed at line number
        Performance issues:
            File operations:
                Mouse-cursor lag
            Loading views:
                switching views is slower than reloading them
                existing thumbs are loaded asynchronously
                loading is slower than with ls (could be Gvfs, could be the way we render view in GTK. For 25k elements, 0.4s with ls, up to 6s in icon view for Nemo/Caja)

Linux Mint 18.3
===============

    xfce:
        upgrade xfce-terminal to 0.8.0?

    software/repo:
        ensure the presence of google-earth and skype in repo/featured
        install mp3 support without codecs

    desktop-search:
        local files
        web engines
        recent
        apps
        dictionary
        translations

    mintwelcome:
        blurry icons in HiDPI
        consider accompanying the user and hinting at things he/she might want to do (codecs, popular settings, popular apps etc..)

    mintupdate:
        safeguard against package removals (for instance, don't let users perform updates which would remove sensitive packages).
        notice to reboot the computer when appropriate
        kernelwindow: make kernel series column desc-sorted and select the active series
        purge old kernels? https://github.com/Pjotr123/purge-old-kernels-2

    system:
        compiler optimization: consider optimizing compiled binaries for Cinnamon/Xapps

    nemo:
        video thumbnails are blurry?

Roadmap
=======

    mintreport:
        mint notices
        implement rules and notification system:
        dmesg errors
        foreign packages if pinned by mint
        wrong lsb info..etc.
        slow boot sequence
        slow shutdown sequence

    implement an alarm clock

    cinnamon:
        menu keywords: looking for display in menu shows color first
        consider: notifications stay on desktop until mouse is moved + a few secs
        preferences > keyboard > custom shortcuts. Used with a Spanish keyboard layout. Recorded: crtl+number and ctrl+Shift+number (e.g. ctrl+1 and ctrl+shift+1 = ctrl+!) they are recorded correctly. When using the shortcut the command defined in the shift combination is triggered with just ctrl+number (i.e. ctrl+1). The complete combination triggers nothing (i.e. ctrl+shift+1 does nothing) and the comand defined in ctrl+number can never be used. This worked in 17.3.
        track/troubleshoot shutdown sequence (user should know what is happening when shutdown isn't immediate)
        track/troubleshoot vsync, compositing, unredirected windows and policy
        menu: consider adopting this layout (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Panacea-Projects/Gnomenu/master/Screenshot.png), same as ours/mintmenu, only better.
        todo list applet/desklet
        calendar events applet/desklet
        multiple clocks https://github.com/simonwiles/cinnamon_applets
        network applet: airplane mode (quick way to rfkill all)
        nemo: retire computer:/// place (which is completely useless) or revamp it into something better
        alt-tab and panel use icon provided by appsys, ignoring icon set by the application itself (example: a python window using widow.set_icon_name())
        actions in panel launchers aren't translated if not present in .desktop file
        gnome-system-monitor moves out of place in Expo
        When using Cinnamon bar at top, and secondary monitor with higher height than the main display, some apps like KDE Apps (Krita, Kdenlive) or Wine Based Apps (teamviewer) will display menus from toolbar in the wrong place. Being more specific: The menus will be displayed in the position that they should be displayed at main monitor, however in this case the window is maximized in the secondary monitor.
        Is there any reason why there are two names for the same item, eg. "Trash" and "Rubbish Bin"? Would it be better to standardise on only one name?
        add gnome-screenshot to panel, right-click and select "Take screenshot of a selected area". This runs gnome-screenshot -a.. it should work but it doesn't. Is it because of the panel launcher capturing the click event or something?

    xapps
        add an option to blank other monitors when in full screen in xviewer/xreader/pix
        implement an app-sharing protocol to quickly move a document from one app to another

        gestures support:
            pinch:
                zoom document in pix
                zoom view in nemo

            swipe:
                previous/next document in pix

            scroll:
                sound-volume/seek in xplayer

            click:
                pause/resume in xplayer

            double-click:
                full-screen in xplayer
                full-screen in xviewer

        pix
            doesn't rotate videos when playing them
            vignettes should look better, and the same in all themes
            support prefer-dark-themes
            treeview in sidebar shows unecessary "(empty)" when dirs have no subdirs

    artwork:
        Tray icons are black with mint-y themes.
        Mint-Y themes Shade option is unavailable
        mint-x-icons: network status icons have a dark background in panel 33px and bigger (sound icon looks wrong in 41px and bigger).
        mint-y The maximize/restore window control button doesnâ€™t change visually between in maximized and restored state (default theme and Mint-Y-Dark)

    kde:
        SDDM stays in autologin after OEM install

R&D
===

    mintupdate:
        prompt for reboot after kernel install?

    nemo:
        remove duplication between Eject and Safely Remove (for removable devices).

    system
        consider adding snapd
        consider adding flatpak
        consider enabling recommends

    review logind.conf changes in:
        MATE
        Xfce
        KDE

    ubiquity:
        inhibit sessions via libxapp (need to do it in KDE too)

    libindicator++?
        client-rendered icon/menu (ala libindicator)
        support all the features from GTK statusicon (tooltips, left/right clicks etc..)

    use aptdaemon?
        aptdaemon doesn't work in LMDE and is being abandoned upstream
        in mintupdate, remove dep on synaptic, remove admin rights for checkAPT.py
        in mintwelcome and codec menu entry, switch from apturl to aptdaemon
        in mintsources, remove dep on synaptic
        remove synaptic from default selection
        remove synaptic from mintmenu's favorites

    network discovery:
        easy out-of-the-box interactions (messaging/presence/file-sharing) over the LAN

    windows compatibility layer:
        seamless wine integration

    HiDPI support:
        upstream apps using GTK2: Gimp, Hexchat, VLC, Pidgin, Tomboy.
        mint projects using GTK2: gksu

LMDE 3
======

    gnome-calculator app title is "gnome-calculator"
    live-installer should show partition labels
