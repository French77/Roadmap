Settings -> Backgrounds : On the left pane, you can’t select “Pictures” folder by clicking, you need to use the keyboard – Down key..
After log-out & log-in back, the update manager icon stays there but nothing happens when you left or right click on it..
When trying to start xed as root it takes approx. 20 seconds for the xed window to display while displays it at once.
Wireless not showing in Network Manager even though it appears in Network Manager Settings.
Cinnamon setting to disable the touch pad while typing does not work, which makes typing on the laptop pretty annoying.
The slideshow that shows during installation shows screenshots from a previous release, which still uses mint-X, and is therefore inconsistent. 
machine will not hibernate, (either from the power button (the hibernate option is selected) or from the exit menu) the screen blanks for a couple of seconds then returns to the session)

panel/osd
	changing sound volume via hotkey shows two on-screen-displays
	pulseaudio item has two onscreen notifications
	panel date and time item is set as bitstream vera fonts, but bitstream vera fonts not installed
	digital clock would not stay in the panel, only the analog version
	editing the panel clock item in anyway it won’t display anymore user need to remove clock then add again
	clock applet doesn't let you use custom format
	too many notification and status notifiers panel items, don’t know which one to control, they all have the same basic options. https://i.imgur.com/fmyhhdp.png
	After switching to a guest session and back to my session, the wifi indicator appeared twice in the notification area.

touchpad
	Elan touchpad’s ‘tap to click’ and ‘right click’ functions not working and can’t be set because they are not shown in touchpad settings (in cinnamon it’s fine and shown up).
	Touchpad tap would not work until I installed synaptics touchpad

software
	No pressure sensitivity when I tried Krita. Ugee’s graphics display pen not seen as mouse either. Both Krita and Ugee 2150 (and Huion) worked perfectly in Mint 18.1 and 18.3, Cinnamon/Mate versions.


tools
	mintdesktop shows a sidepanel with only one item in it
	can’t add any PPA

artwork
	Network Icon in Tray is not monochrome, like the rest of the Mint Y icons
	xed display right margin at column does nothing. in dark mode with classic and other themes highlight current line colors need to be inverted

The ‘fortune’ command results in the output ‘no fortunes found’. I’m not against getting rid of ‘fortune’, but if it is installed (which it is, according to the software manager) it should work. 
can’t see the share remote desktop ….. i went to menu/preferences but then no desktop sharing was there
Despite installing open-vm-tools-desktop window resizing does not work
Suspend worked, but would not ask for my password. I set screen lock in power manager, which I think fixed this in the past, but then it would not suspend at all.
After installing Opera Browser, on first opening after login, I keep getting the message “The login keyring did not get unlocked when you logged into your computer”. Then it asks for my password (solution is to autostart  gnome-keyring-daemon -r)
wifi dongle rtl8192eu is not being recognized, but the generic rtl8xxxu-driver is being loaded instead yielding a 1mbs connection speed — totally unacceptable.
Using a live boot session in VirtualBox no longer allows copy-and-paste between the host and the Linux Mint live boot session, and resizing the VirtualBox window for that session does not resize Linux Mint within that session. Version 18.2 and several prior versions would do both copy-and-paste (to and from the host) and resize the VirtualBox session window easily.
	I wrote up how and why to use this feature in a blog post a couple of years ago, and it has been quite helpful for myself and my readers.
