-----------------------------------------------
    [Fixed in Git] clock applet doesn't support custom formats in vertical mode
    [Fixed in Git] use mate-panel in fallback mode
    [Fixed in Git] notification sound, by default the file name for the sound is my username (without ending like .oga). This file does not exist.

    [collinss] Right-click an icon on the panel, select “options”, then “edit”. Try to choose a new icon. The new icon shows in the window. Try to click “OK”. It won’t click and the icon won’t change.
    [mtwebster] nemo: Prefs > Display > Icon Caption > first option SIZE, and Prefs > Preview > Folders > options NEVER ---> results in "–" showing under directories (tested in icon view).
    [mtwebster] screensaver:
        please make clock jumping less frequent (5 seconds right now?)
        If the display for the time gets disabled, also the absence message does not get shown. I think, both should be independent from each other.
        should never lock a live session
        process name should be set
        RTL: http://imgur.com/a/0hqqY
        in 1152×864 the clock is over the password field
        When I write too much words when I lock the screen, those letters interfere the login dialog. I think we need a wrap of strings there.
    [mtwebster] menu: bring back category hover delay option
    Panel menu text reposition, most used option ‘Close’ returns to the bottom (nearest mouse option)
        Current http://pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=109583
        Proposed, also reduces menu height (GIMP mock-up) http://pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=109584
    System Info (Upload System Information) “This includes no personal information”, possibly shorten to ‘Includes no personal information’, or ‘No personal information included’?
    Problem with the width of some configuration windows: E. G. with the configuration window for window list applet.
    Qt 5.7 looks bad
    vmware support (windows are translucent)
    With VirtualBox 5.1.10 and VboxGuestAdditions (GA) installed race condition happens approximately 60% of the time after login (CSD high CPU usage).
        After around 1 min 45 sec of black screen and high CPU usage Cinnamon crashes, Gnome desktop appears, CPU usage remains high, at which point ran System Monitor and Top
        http://pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=109572
        http://pasteall.org/pic/show.php?id=109574
        After around 9 minutes of high CPU usage the process reaches 3 GiB virtual memory then crashes, desktop resets and offending process memory drops to 1.5 KiB
    menu: recent icon is different than in nemo sidebar
