New bug reports in Linux Mint 18.3 BETA

All editions
------------
	compatibility mode in EFI?

	mintinstall
		some flatpaks are missing icons
		if you use the tab key to move between the Featured application, Editors’ Picks and Categories, you can find yourself in a position where you have one from each selected category simultaneously – so you can’t hit the Enter key. There are in all likelihood shortcut keys for the Software Manager that i’m unaware of, but just saying this isn’t great. Related to this, when i try to install a package, i have to use my mouse – is that correct, i can’t seem to be able to select Install by tabbing over to it or selecting CTRL+I.

	mintsources:
		search for ubuntu mirror -> freeze/crash

	mintupdate:
		no window progress when installing/removing kernel
		check window size in 1024x768 with panel

	gnome-keyring-daemon delays session quit
	switch audio to HDMI, disconnect HDMI, it's not possible to switch back then
	startup apps: 1) install Caffeine or any other software that will appear in Startup Applications, 2) uninstall it, 3) Open Startup Application and the link is still there

	I don't see the point for the energy-setting switch "enable hibernate" - it's available in different menus already, even if the switch is disabled.
	If you remove an active theme, it's not switched to the default theme as it was before.
	The menu-applet animation is still very sluggish (if enabled). Why not use a simple fade in effect like in the good old days? All other transitions look great!
