New bug reports in Linux Mint 19 BETA

All editions
------------

thunderbird icon isn't the same as its flatpak
Shutdown takes forever: “A stop job is running for Cryptography Setup for cryptoswap1” takes over 5 minutes
love the new icons, but for video and subtitle icons
systemd-udev cause high cpu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/1767968?comments=all
Firefox bookmarks don’t use the folder color picked in the Cinnamon theme setting.
Software Center does only wait and not warn if synaptic is open.
gdebi crashes
wine doesn't work (upstream issue in 18.04)
suggestion – add firewall enablement to welcome app.
suggestion (for a future release) – have an option for update manager to initiate a timeshift backup prior to applying upgrades.
uninstalling flatpak from menu doesn't work (tried with VLC)
ms ttf fonts says it is installed but when i go to fonts to use arial black there are no fonts i fixed this by uninstalling from software manager reboot and reinstalling them then reboot then it works i like my arial black and 1 of the few reasons i use lm verses all other distros
mintupdate is still conflicting with VM guest pkgs... installing them removes mintupdate
Linux Mint Welcome Screen also is incompatible with the drivers for VirtualBox as it removed them also upon install

mintdrivers: The text in “Authenticate” window that comes up when i click on Driver Manager is not fully translated. I’m using it with PT-BR language. The only thing that is translated is the bold text that appears above the explanation text. Buttons, window title, explanation text and “Password” are not.
When installing to internal 16GB SSD and with option “Something else” using the whole SSD for mountpoint root, installation always hangs in both XFCE 64 and Cinnamon 64. Ubuntu 18.04 installer with same options has no problem.
mintupdate: On first time use, the preferences section “jumps” on the screen.
The quick filter is missing in synaptic.

mint-y:
	with mint-y-darker, open an additional pane (F3) in nemo, select a folder in the left page, click in the right pane. The selected folder in the left pane is white on grey, almost invisible.

mint-x:
	no icon when the update manager cannot connect to the server, no icons in Online accounts > Information about Gnome online accounts -> Gnome Contacts, Gnome Documents, Gnome Maps and Gnome Photos

What about Java software? It is not being installed by default during the installation (even if I selected to install additional 3-party software)? Anyway after manually installing the openjdk-8-jre or openjdk-11-jre, LibreOffice is not working properly (in the LO preferences Java is visible…) – mainly LibreOffice Base (creating database is not possible)… Could you please check this from your side?

i can not read video like mpeg or mp4 (with ubuntu mate 18.04 live or xubuntu 18.04 live, i can, now mp3 and mp4 codec is public domain, that’s why, no need to install extra codec to read those ones 

auto-login from installer doesn't work?

When using RTL language (in this case Hebrew) in the right click menu on the window header the icons and check boxes go over the text. https://imgur.com/a/fISEJJA

I found a bug while trying to connect the gnome calendar to google.
	Steps to reproduce :
	1. Open calendar
	2. select calendar settings from the icon on the right of search
	3. Click on google account in the online accounts section
	4. Click on google in the online accounts window that opens up
	Expected behavior : it takes you to google’s login page
	Actual behavior : it opens a window with nothing in it (not even sure if it’s a browser window)

Boot hangs 1 minute with “gave up waiting for suspend/resume device”
	there seems to be a wrong uuid for resume in initramfs.
	Temporarily solution is here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1013830/slow-boot-long-kernel-load-time-due-to-wrong-resume-device

------------------------------------------------------------------

Settings -> Backgrounds : On the left pane, you can’t select “Pictures” folder by clicking, you need to use the keyboard – Down key..
After log-out & log-in back, the update manager icon stays there but nothing happens when you left or right click on it..
When trying to start xed as root it takes approx. 20 seconds for the xed window to display while displays it at once.
Wireless not showing in Network Manager even though it appears in Network Manager Settings.
Cinnamon setting to disable the touch pad while typing does not work, which makes typing on the laptop pretty annoying.
The slideshow that shows during installation shows screenshots from a previous release, which still uses mint-X, and is therefore inconsistent. 
machine will not hibernate, (either from the power button (the hibernate option is selected) or from the exit menu) the screen blanks for a couple of seconds then returns to the session)
I disabled the option to block the screen in every case. This works when the screensaver is activated automatically by time. But when I close the lid, It blocks the screen and asks the password when I open.
The dropbox icon in the bottom right bar is too small.
After adding a color profile, gnome-color-manager won’t auto install when I click “view details.” I have to install it manually in the terminal, software manager or synaptic.
On Vivaldi when I full screen a youtube video, the dashboard always remains displayed. Same on Firefox.
terminal: Just installed it with Hebrew as the system language and there’s something really weird with the fonts on the terminal. https://imgur.com/a/OHjoBu8
cinnamon themes hardcode the font
No way to set brightness for battery VS AC power.
Installing in VirtualBox give error “Running in software rendering mode”
I can not log in with my ubuntu one account in “online accounts” in system settings
 If the screen is rotated, then the touch screen digitiser and trackpad both move the cursor in a direction mirrored to what is expected ie move your finger to the left on the screen and the cursor moves to the right. This works properly in Gnome.
I found a little bug in the Desklet “Analog Chronometer”. I can not call the settings when I have downloaded and switched on the Chronometer.
 Two Skype icons are displayed on the panel near the time.
Installing Pysolfc via Synaptic and also Software Manager. No Games directory added to the menu. Though game worked from within a terminal. Restarting the computer the Menu was properly populated.
When I edit an application in “Startup Applications”, and it has a delay, the seconds unit “s” disappears.
Even after authorize Samba in gufw, Nemo doesn’t show the local network and machine on it. I must manually type smb://user@ip to get in (after workgroup and password) In Mint 18 that was directly available.
Some applications that I installed through additional ppa (like 4kvideodownloader), to open through the menu, I need to restart the computer. Other applications that I installed through additional ppa (like qbittorrent and woeusb) work without having to restart.
The Telegram icon in the bottom right bar is too small, like Dropbox icon. But it works well.
The Skype icon in the bottom right bar is a little deformed, but also works well.
when adding new Menu items to the Menu, The Icon’s won’t save.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Folder color yellow is missing (Mint-Y)
Sticky Notes double click doesnt highlight
Windows Manager Metacity+Compton puts red line around app window
provide network/sound panel icons
preferred apps: caja, onboard, orca aren't selected
ubiquity: click rel notes, nothing happens
update manager toolbar is too big
When installing beta 19 mate, from a live USB thumb drive version, my screen goes BLANK during the install to the hard drive in spite of the fact that I had turned off ALL screensaver and power management features on the live USB session. Once I got the install done to the hard drive and again turned off the screensaver and power management the problem did not repeat.

--------------------------------------------------------------

panel/osd
	changing sound volume via hotkey shows two on-screen-displays
	pulseaudio item has two onscreen notifications
	panel date and time item is set as bitstream vera fonts, but bitstream vera fonts not installed
	digital clock would not stay in the panel, only the analog version
	editing the panel clock item in anyway it won’t display anymore user need to remove clock then add again
	clock applet doesn't let you use custom format
	too many notification and status notifiers panel items, don’t know which one to control, they all have the same basic options. https://i.imgur.com/fmyhhdp.png
	After switching to a guest session and back to my session, the wifi indicator appeared twice in the notification area.

touchpad
	Elan touchpad’s ‘tap to click’ and ‘right click’ functions not working and can’t be set because they are not shown in touchpad settings (in cinnamon it’s fine and shown up).
	Touchpad tap would not work until I installed synaptics touchpad

software
	No pressure sensitivity when I tried Krita. Ugee’s graphics display pen not seen as mouse either. Both Krita and Ugee 2150 (and Huion) worked perfectly in Mint 18.1 and 18.3, Cinnamon/Mate versions.


tools
	mintdesktop shows a sidepanel with only one item in it
	can’t add any PPA

artwork
	Network Icon in Tray is not monochrome, like the rest of the Mint Y icons
	xed display right margin at column does nothing. in dark mode with classic and other themes highlight current line colors need to be inverted

The ‘fortune’ command results in the output ‘no fortunes found’. I’m not against getting rid of ‘fortune’, but if it is installed (which it is, according to the software manager) it should work. 
can’t see the share remote desktop ….. i went to menu/preferences but then no desktop sharing was there
Despite installing open-vm-tools-desktop window resizing does not work
Suspend worked, but would not ask for my password. I set screen lock in power manager, which I think fixed this in the past, but then it would not suspend at all.
After installing Opera Browser, on first opening after login, I keep getting the message “The login keyring did not get unlocked when you logged into your computer”. Then it asks for my password (solution is to autostart  gnome-keyring-daemon -r)
wifi dongle rtl8192eu is not being recognized, but the generic rtl8xxxu-driver is being loaded instead yielding a 1mbs connection speed — totally unacceptable.
Using a live boot session in VirtualBox no longer allows copy-and-paste between the host and the Linux Mint live boot session, and resizing the VirtualBox window for that session does not resize Linux Mint within that session. Version 18.2 and several prior versions would do both copy-and-paste (to and from the host) and resize the VirtualBox session window easily.
	I wrote up how and why to use this feature in a blog post a couple of years ago, and it has been quite helpful for myself and my readers.
