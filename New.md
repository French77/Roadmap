New bug reports in Linux Mint 19 BETA

All editions - last processed comment: June 12, 2018 at 2:50 pm
---------------------------------------------------------------

- check that ISO installed in BIOS mode (USB stick)
- Gnome calendar does not have an icon on the top left in the new Gnome decorations, only a cog icon is shown.
- update inxi
- update timeshift to 18.06

slick:
  - On a VirtualBox setup with three users, if any user but the first is auto given focus, the username is present but the box only has half height, cut off with no password entry lower half. You can type where that password entry half of the box would be , and it works, but the characters don't show, so it's a visual display problem, only apparently happening on boot.

artwork:
  - improve status icons: nm-signal-, volume-audio-, power icons
  - slideshow: old screenshots, still using mint-x.

mint tools:
  - mintupdate:
    - conflicts with VM guest pkgs... installing them removes mintupdate (and mintwelcome)
    - refreshing the mintinstall cache slows down checkAPT
    - systray doesn't move to green check mark after all updates are applied
    - https://github.com/linuxmint/mintupdate/issues/362

ubiquity:
  - click rel notes, nothing happens

base:
  - Shutdown takes forever: “A stop job is running for Cryptography Setup for cryptoswap1” takes over 5 minutes
  - systemd-udev cause high cpu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/udev/+bug/1767968?comments=all
  - Boot hangs 1 minute with “gave up waiting for suspend/resume device”
		there seems to be a wrong uuid for resume in initramfs.
		Temporarily solution is here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/1013830/slow-boot-long-kernel-load-time-due-to-wrong-resume-device

xplayer:
  - In fullscreen mode, it starts misbehaving after a while. Video freezes/goes black, sound is still there. Keyboard is lost. Mouse pointer moves, but no action can be taken. Reset button on box only option.
  - 'Fit Window to Movie' does not work.
  - In some videos with subtitles, Xplayer does not show them, even if I select them in the menu. It happened to me in a .mkv file, but I do not know if it happens in other types of files. In these cases, I use VLC.
  - Booted from the LM19 live CD (linuxmint-19-mate-32bit-beta.iso), installed smplayer (%sudo apt-get install --install-recommends smplayer).
		Marco: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos correctly.
		Marco Compositing: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos as described previously.
		Marco Compton: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos as described previously.
		Metacity: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos correctly.
		Metacity Compositing: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos as described previously.
		Metacity Compton: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos as described previously.
		Compiz: smplayer displays .flv and .mp4 videos correctly.
		AOpen MX4SG-4DN motherboard, Intel 865G Graphics Memory Controller Hub.
		xplayer segfaults in all cases above ^^

Cinnamon Edition
----------------

settings:
  - [confirmed] ccc: in color plugin, add a profile, browse it and click "View details". If gnome-color-manager is not installed, the plugin should ask packagekit (over dbus) to install it. This doesn't work.

csd:
  - If the screen is rotated, then the touch screen digitiser and trackpad both move the cursor in a direction mirrored to what is expected ie move your finger to the left on the screen and the cursor moves to the right. This works properly in Gnome.
  - Another problem: When in tablet mode (that is, the screen is rotated and covering the keyboard) the RotateWindows key doesn't work anymore... It just does nothing...
  - csd-power: https://github.com/linuxmint/cinnamon-settings-daemon/issues/209

other:
  - machine will not hibernate, (either from the power button (the hibernate option is selected) or from the exit menu) the screen blanks for a couple of seconds then returns to the session)
  - Even after authorize Samba in gufw, Nemo doesn’t show the local network and machine on it. I must manually type smb://user@ip to get in (after workgroup and password) In Mint 18 that was directly available.

- NFS mount not visible in Nemo left menu. How to reproduce: install nfs-common, mount NFS folder.
- With panel set to “smart hide”: if panel was never hidden since the beginning of the session, the status of mintupdate is working as expected. Once panel is hidden (by maximizing a window) the mintupdate tray icon remains static for the rest of the session.
- Wanting to add a new custom Menu category to adding ones own Items to a category is like pulling teeth. Icon's don't save, Can't arrange Items and etc. No way to add desktop Files to the menu after they have already been created.
- NTFS pen drive is not mounting
- Unable to unlock the screensaver via LDAP with libpam-ldap and nscd packages installed pointing to an openldap server.

MATE Edition
------------

- screen goes blank during the install despite all screensaver/power management being turned OFF. Post-install, with everything OFF again, screensaver/power management are disabled properly.
- When I want to shut down, the dialog offers «Hibernate» (which I never tried, because it could not work with a small swap-file). But when I first log out and login as another user, the computer remembers that there is an file /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority/10-vendor.d/com.ubuntu.desktop.pkla, which disable the hibernation. Afterwards the quit-dialog will never show to hibernate until reboot. I did not noticed this effect on Ubuntu Mate 18.04 on the same machine (hibernation is still disabled).
- Custom actions created with Caja Actions are not appearing in Caja's context menu, whereas they did in Mint 18.3. Is there some reason this might be occurring?

Xfce Edition
------------

- Suspend worked, but would not ask for my password. I set screen lock in power manager, which I think fixed this in the past, but then it would not suspend at all.
