		HP LaserJet 5000 on parallel port – Device URI: parallel:/dev/lp0 Buffer overflow error when printing. hpcups 3.16.3. Works in Mint 13 and 15, but not in 17.x/18.
		Am testing on a lenovo w530. Bluetooth applet cant seem to pick any device. It will just display searching for devices and either provide an empty list or list devices i cannot setup. On 17.3 it worked like a charm
		3c:00.0 Network controller: Qualcomm Atheros QCA6174 802.11ac Wireless Network Adapter (rev 32), "wireless unavailable"
		Fatal resolution problem with all 16.04 derivatives https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/292402
		Lenovo Y700 no sound
		Ethernet - no connection - Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 0c)
		ath10k WiFi doesn’t work. 4.5 kernel needed (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-firmware/+bug/1520343)
		No sound (worked in 17.3): Audio: Card-1 Intel 8 Series/C220 Series High Definition Audio Controller, driver: snd_hda_intel bus-ID: 00:1b.0 Sound: Advanced Linux Sound Architecture v: k4.4.0-24-generic

		in Czech Search in firefox does not work. Both from adress bar and from search bar. Search setting is unaccessible?
	artwork:
		Tray icons are black with mint-y themes.
		Mint-Y themes Shade option is unavailable
		Black Themed Bar: Icons not vertically centered.
		Mint-Y needs a tiny window border or drop shadow. It can be very difficult to distinguish where one window ends and another begins.
		login screen, no user selected, username don't show up very well on some of the backgrounds
		Mint-Y Icon theme doesn’t show document contents. Mint-X icon variants can show the content of a text file without any problems, but this is not the case with Mint-Y. If Mint-Y will never support such a feature, I would suggest using an icon that indicates a text file, rather than the blank placeholder icon.
		Mint-Y:  I dislike these borderless windows. When I snap applications next to each other on the screen, the content just seems to run into eachother and almost looks cut off. I know it’s not actually being cut off, but without even a thin border it gives off that impression.
	mintbackup:
		can't save software selection (X error)
		can't restore software selection?

-----------------------------------------------
	changing desktop font size segfaults nemo
	Touch screen clicks are not working in the icon and compact view section of Nemo, everywhere else seems fine.
	Context menu “Open with>other application…” displays duplicate applications.
	I can disable mobile broadband using the switch in network preferences but it does have any effect. Next time I open up network preferences it is enabled again. I guess this could be a upstream problem though.
	white font? http://imgur.com/QBEM48H

	When connecting with PEAP authentication, the network manager applet just gets stuck instead of prompting for credentials.
	cinnamon panel unresponsive when using nvidia 304 drivers?
	When using the Laptop with external Monitor, it isn’t possible to maximize windows on laptop panel. They will always maximize on the HDMI monitor instead. Same behaviour I had on my 17.3 Setup
	panel: right-click -> paste applet configuration doesn't work
	nemo-preview does not close properly, press space to open it, press space to close it... you end up with an empty window.
	choose Mint-Y-Dark for controls: all blue “more info” links in spices’ online lists can’t be read on the dark background
	switch user with mdmflexiserver, log back in -> mouse cursor doesn't show up (comes back after a while if you type on keyboard)
	virtual keyboard: I used to click on the applet “on-screen-keyboard” and it came in focus (and only then). For this to work I have to enable it in the accessibility settings. With Cinnamon 3.0.x, this woks too, but the keyboard is popping up every each and then (click on menu etc.) and not only if I use the applet. Could this be adjusted?
	When moving the panel, or resizing the panel, the desktop icons sometimes disappear. (Solution is to start/restart Nemo.)
	cinnamon: place two panels (bottom and top), add application menu applet to top panel, left zone. when menu is open, hover the applet icon.. it makes the applet flicker.
	in the new ubuntu 16.04, touchegg works with 3 finger gestures, if I put synclient disable ClickFinger3 & TapButton3, however, in linux mint it’s not recognizing it..! any plans to fix this?
	Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R video recording crashes and throws Cinnamon into fallback mode
	When scrolling down in the Menu smoothly, icons/items leave some “traces” behind, if you can call it that
	“Automatically connect to VPN when using this connection” option for a WiFi network connection is failing upon startup. It then connects to the wifi without the VPN.
	connected to vpn (cisco to be exact), it doesn’t display network icon with lock when connected in the system tray compared to previous version.
	system settings modules don't use the icon (in alt-tab, and window list) associated with the menu item

MATE Edition - last processed comment: #142
-------------------------------------------
	network-manager | nm-applet:
		After I resume from suspend NetworkManager seems to work fine, Wifi connection is maintained, but nm-applet shows Wi-Fi Networks and other things grayed out. Running ‘pkill nm-applet’ and then ‘nm-applet’ fixes this.
		Can't join WPA network (password not being passed), 3 people have this problem
		after updates nm-applet shows ethernet icon instead of wifi for connections?
		nm connecting via WPA doesn't connect (no password passed).. using network connections to save the password -> works. Tested with MATE edition on a Lenovo Yoga 500.
		Another NetworkManager bug. Just tried to run the mint 18 MATE live on an old pc in my home and it wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi at all. It just looked as if I didn’t have Wi-Fi. Killing and restarting nm-applet didn’t help in this case, so the bug must be deeper. Sadly, this is a bug I’ve read about in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 so again, this might be a bug from upstream. For comparison, I had no problem of this sort when running mint cinnamon 18 live on this pc, and it is running mint Xfce (first 17.2, upgraded to 17.3) for a while and never had this problem.
	mintmenu:
		[Fixed in Git] use custom color should be disabled by default (it makes mintmenu look really bad with mint-y-dark)
		transparent only one after reboot (first click on menu). Next click menu show not transparent
		weird org.mate.panel.applet.MintMenuAppletFactory in syslog when running synaptic
	very frequent “at-spi-registryd.desktop not responding” error at reboot/shutdown and it’s associated very slow reboot/shutdown
	In the prefered applications(menu Preferences, “Prefered applications”), Caja isn’t the File manager by default. Must add it manually.
	when changing the appearance to Mint-Y-Dark the background in caja doesn’t change! you have to go to “Edit” -> “Backgrounds and Emblems” and reset it once manually. now it changes every time with the theme.
