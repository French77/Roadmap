New bug reports in Linux Mint 19.1 BETA

mintdriver:
	After a standard install, I ran Driver Manager and chose to change from the default nouveau driver to the nvidia-590 driver. Rebooted and all good.
    I then switched back to the nouveau driver, and rebooted.
    When I now go into Driver Manager, it says I have manually installed a driver and it will not allow me to select either the nouveau or nvidia-590 driver.
