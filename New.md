New bug reports in Linux Mint 18.1 BETA

All editions
------------
    mdm:
        Webkit preview, process doesn't die when window is closed
        Webkit preview, mint-X doesn't show anything, only background
    steam doesn't run out of the box.
    system:
        Unrecognized audio devices “Dummy output”. ProBook 470 G4. Audio was fine in Sarah.
    slideshow:
        [Awaiting translations] pix icon is wrong
        [Awaiting translations] remove banshee
    xed search:
        [Fixed in Git] typing shouldn't move to next result
        [Fixed in Git] pressing case button should perform the search

-----------------------------------------------
    [Fixed in Git] clock applet doesn't support custom formats in vertical mode
    [Fixed in Git] use mate-panel in fallback mode
    [Fixed in Git] notification sound, by default the file name for the sound is my username (without ending like .oga). This file does not exist.

    [collinss] Right-click an icon on the panel, select “options”, then “edit”. Try to choose a new icon. The new icon shows in the window. Try to click “OK”. It won’t click and the icon won’t change.
    [mtwebster] nemo: Prefs > Display > Icon Caption > first option SIZE, and Prefs > Preview > Folders > options NEVER ---> results in "–" showing under directories (tested in icon view).
    [mtwebster] screensaver:
        please make clock jumping less frequent (5 seconds right now?)
        If the display for the time gets disabled, also the absence message does not get shown. I think, both should be independent from each other.
        should never lock a live session
        process name should be set
        RTL: http://imgur.com/a/0hqqY
        in 1152×864 the clock is over the password field
    [mtwebster] menu: bring back category hover delay option

    Problem with the width of some configuration windows: E. G. with the configuration window for window list applet.
    Is the speed (not acceleration) of the mouse pointer finally changable via the settings? This did not work for years now
    When running cinnamon live session, attempting to do a restart via the button on the cinnamon menu causes the screen to hang on the cinnamon logo as the system begins to shut down.
    Qt 5.7 looks bad
    vmware support (windows are translucent)

MATE Edition - last processed comment: #40
------------------------------------------
    Control Center | Appearance | Interface: I see that “Show icons in menus” works with xed, but “Toolbar button labels” does not
    Optical glitch in “Steuerzentrale” (Control Center?). With Mint-Y Dark theme (other dark ones may apply also). Group of settings selected on the left tree => highlighted section is unreadable: light font color bleeds into the light background color.
