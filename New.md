New bug reports in Linux Mint 18.2 BETA

All editions
------------

	mintupdate:
		In the past when updating packages completed the ‘Details’ window would stay open until I clicked the ‘Closed’ button. This is no longer true.
		shouldn't show up in guest session
		kernel headers for 4.4 confuse ppl
		update policy choice doesn't stick
		Clicking Linux kernel headers 4.4, and selecting ‘Ignore updates for this package’ has no effect. Understandable for newer kernel/kernel headers update?

	mintwelcome:
		shouldn't show up in guest session

	mintinstall:
		can't access office category

    Slick greeter / lightdm-settings:
        session badges look blurry in HiDPI
        file pickers don't seem to show gsettings value when no value is defined in .conf
        background color doesn't seem to work
        wrong logitech keyboard layout: https://github.com/linuxmint/slick-greeter/issues/46

	The ‘netspeed-applet 1.18.1’ now continuously resizes as the bitrate changes. Installed between the ‘Clock’ and ‘Notification Area’ means all the icons in the notification area jump around a lot. Now that’s annoying! Hopefully this will be fixed.
	The ‘indicator-keylock 3.1.0’ app while ‘working’, i.e. when the the CapsLock key is pressed, a notification popup appears, at present in 18.2 the ‘indicator-keylock’ preference settings are not respected by the ‘mate-panel’. Previously, the ‘indicator-keylock’ icon would appear on the mate-panel, ONLY when the CapsLock key was pressed and disappear again when the CapsLock key was deactivated. Now the ‘indicator-keylock’ icon remains visible all the time. This may be a ‘mate-panel 1.18.2’ or lightdm issue, idk?
	mate-panel:
		when applying a bg color, the “Window List” remains unchanged.
		freezes everytime I try to add or move a launcher (icon) to it.
	Sticky Notes: no marking, copy possible – double clicking now opens “Sticky Notes Properties”
