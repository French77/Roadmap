		Am testing on a lenovo w530. Bluetooth applet cant seem to pick any device. It will just display searching for devices and either provide an empty list or list devices i cannot setup. On 17.3 it worked like a charm

	changing desktop font size segfaults nemo
	Touch screen clicks are not working in the icon and compact view section of Nemo, everywhere else seems fine.
	Context menu “Open with>other application…” displays duplicate applications.
	I can disable mobile broadband using the switch in network preferences but it does have any effect. Next time I open up network preferences it is enabled again. I guess this could be a upstream problem though.

	When connecting with PEAP authentication, the network manager applet just gets stuck instead of prompting for credentials.
	cinnamon panel unresponsive when using nvidia 304 drivers?
	When using the Laptop with external Monitor, it isn’t possible to maximize windows on laptop panel. They will always maximize on the HDMI monitor instead. Same behaviour I had on my 17.3 Setup
	panel: right-click -> paste applet configuration doesn't work

	network-manager | nm-applet:
		After I resume from suspend NetworkManager seems to work fine, Wifi connection is maintained, but nm-applet shows Wi-Fi Networks and other things grayed out. Running ‘pkill nm-applet’ and then ‘nm-applet’ fixes this.
		Can't join WPA network (password not being passed), 3 people have this problem
		after updates nm-applet shows ethernet icon instead of wifi for connections?
		nm connecting via WPA doesn't connect (no password passed).. using network connections to save the password -> works. Tested with MATE edition on a Lenovo Yoga 500.
		Another NetworkManager bug. Just tried to run the mint 18 MATE live on an old pc in my home and it wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi at all. It just looked as if I didn’t have Wi-Fi. Killing and restarting nm-applet didn’t help in this case, so the bug must be deeper. Sadly, this is a bug I’ve read about in Ubuntu MATE 16.04 so again, this might be a bug from upstream. For comparison, I had no problem of this sort when running mint cinnamon 18 live on this pc, and it is running mint Xfce (first 17.2, upgraded to 17.3) for a while and never had this problem.
	mintmenu:
		[Fixed in Git] use custom color should be disabled by default (it makes mintmenu look really bad with mint-y-dark)
		transparent only one after reboot (first click on menu). Next click menu show not transparent
		weird org.mate.panel.applet.MintMenuAppletFactory in syslog when running synaptic
	very frequent “at-spi-registryd.desktop not responding” error at reboot/shutdown and it’s associated very slow reboot/shutdown
	In the prefered applications(menu Preferences, “Prefered applications”), Caja isn’t the File manager by default. Must add it manually.
	when changing the appearance to Mint-Y-Dark the background in caja doesn’t change! you have to go to “Edit” -> “Backgrounds and Emblems” and reset it once manually. now it changes every time with the theme.
