Can't reproduce
---------------
  xplayer does not adapt to the size of the video being played. In Preferences, Display, there is the option 'Resize the window when opening a new movie'. By removing the check from that, you can resize the window manually. Otherwise on the sides and above or below the video, annoying black bands appear. --> it must depend on the video size and resolution. I can't reproduce it here.

  DM appears briefly in automatic login mode
