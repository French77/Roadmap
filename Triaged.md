Not a bug
---------
	nmap scan found the microsoft-ds ports, open 445 (samba)


Outside of the scope
--------------------
	xplayer + marco: while in full screen mode does not play video smoothly (use compton + mpv for better performance)

Can't reproduce
---------------
	Videos (Xplayer) window cannot be maximized (other windows can);
	mate: snap terminal right (ie drag to take up the right half of the screen) and the text is too far to the left to read the first character in each line.
	mate: control Center > Keyboard > Layouts “Choose a layout” window is gigantic and unresizable
	mate: Firefox Search Engines are missing and cannot add new one. In Cinnamon that works ok.
	mintmenu: when I install a piece of software it doesn’t show up until I log out from the desktop session and log back again, is it something normal or not?
	mozo: sliding an entry between a submenu to another crashes the menu editor and corrupts the menu (all applications disappear). Same problem when deleting a shortcut in the “other” submenu.

Upstream
--------
	32bit version doesn’t support 32bit UEFI
