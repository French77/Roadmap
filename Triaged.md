Outside of the scope

Can't reproduce
---------------
    xed: when you have more than a page, scrolling down (or up) with the down (or up) arrow creates a jerky display; similarly, with a large document, going from the top to the bottom with Ctrl-End (or vice-versa with Ctrl-Home) seems to have an intermediate stage where it is displaying text from somewhere in the middle of the document; reminds me of “smooth” scrolling in Firefox; makes xed unusable for me except for short periods of time or for very short files
    gnome-calculator: takes way to long to exit (for a calculator); it also seems to be thrashing my HDD when it exits

Upstream
--------
    gnome-terminal: the command to close all terminals in the file menu only closes all tabs.
