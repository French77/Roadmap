Can't reproduce
---------------

- mint-x: no icon when the update manager cannot connect to the server
- auto-login from installer doesn't work?
- can't access Google login page from GOA
- cinnamon: I disabled the option to block the screen in every case. This works when the screensaver is activated automatically by time. But when I close the lid, It blocks the screen and asks the password when I open.
- When trying to start xed as root it takes approx. 20 seconds for the xed window to display while displays it at once.
