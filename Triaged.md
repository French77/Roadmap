Not a bug
---------
    mintlocale: I installed (64 bit) with German language. After booting the installed system I find in the language settings the message about incomplete language packs for 4 English and 2 German language variants. The annoying thing is, that each of those 6 language packs have to get installed separately, so this really wastes some time. I did several installs of Serena and found the problem reproducible.

Can't reproduce
---------------
    xed: when you have more than a page, scrolling down (or up) with the down (or up) arrow creates a jerky display; similarly, with a large document, going from the top to the bottom with Ctrl-End (or vice-versa with Ctrl-Home) seems to have an intermediate stage where it is displaying text from somewhere in the middle of the document; reminds me of “smooth” scrolling in Firefox; makes xed unusable for me except for short periods of time or for very short files
    gnome-calculator: takes way to long to exit (for a calculator); it also seems to be thrashing my HDD when it exits

Upstream
--------
    gnome-terminal: the command to close all terminals in the file menu only closes all tabs.
    ubiquity: in user details screen, enter your name, then press tab all the way to the password field (using defaults for username and hostname), the text in the username entry stays selected.
