Fixed Issues since Linux Mint 18 BETA

All editions
------------
	mintsources: warning text uses hardcoded color (looks wrong in mint-y-dark)
	mintsources: can't browse PPA (relies on lsb_release -u)
	mintdrivers: grey font not readable
	Optimus Graphic: When right clicking on nvidia icon, the menu pops up in the top right
	mintbackup just hangs indefinitely when you try to restore software selection, terminal has no output, and mintbackup is using no cpu.
	add curl to default selection
	In the date/time configuration, trying to change Manual by Synchronisation with NTP server. ntp package is not installed.
	Cant seem to be able to set the clock, unlock the setting and set it but it doesn’t hold.
	mintupload: when editing a (non working – e.g. the default “suggested”) account, without changing something (and therefore closing the window with the top right X) the next time i just get an empty tiny Properties-window! you have close the Upload Manager (just the window – not even necessary to restart mintupload) and it is working again.
	mintlocale: Cannot change default System Locale by Language settings. Thus it can be changed manually by text editor. (file: /etc/default/locale)
