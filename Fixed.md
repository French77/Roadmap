All editions
------------

    mintsources:
        doesn't start in some locales due to unicode error (German, Russian..etc) + various unicode issues
        can't add PPA
        segfault in base repository speed tests

    Xed has some untranslated items for pt_BR in the “View, Larger Text, Smaller Text, Normal size” option.
    virtualbox guest support removed (no longer needed, well done Oracle ;))

    mintinstall:
        flatpaks do not install when they miss dependencies (discord for instance)
        the installation/removal progress needs to show more info than just the progressbar
        window is too big and won't maximize in 1024x768
        reset scrolledwindows when appropriate
        fix name collisions in search/lists
        missing xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
        fix flatpaks not showing up in menus on first login
        can't install steam (debconf)
        flatpak spinner should indicate that it will take some time...
        some flatpaks are missing icons

    mintbackup:
        the icon for Personal data (home directory) should be the same as home directory icon

    mintupdate:
        no window progress when installing/removing kernel

    mintreport
        go back and forth between two info and you see the source
