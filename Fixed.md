Fixed Issues since Linux Mint 18.2 BETA

All editions
------------
    redshift-gtk should depend on geoclue-2.0
    onboard is not visible in the app menu

    guest sessions:
        don't start mintwelcome

    slick-greeter/lightdm-settings:
        background color doesn't seem to work
        padding issue when hovering session button
        wrong logitech keyboard layout

    pix:
        Support for Fujifilm RAW files
        Support for EXIF orientation in RAW files

    mintupdate:
        kernel headers for 4.4 confuse ppl
        Clicking Linux kernel headers 4.4, and selecting ‘Ignore updates for this package’ has no effect. Understandable for newer kernel/kernel headers update?
        update policy choice doesn't stick
        don't start mintupdate in guest sessions

    blueberry:
        add a way to disable the autostart

    mintinstall:
        can't access office category (happens in MATE but not in Cinnamon, issue in Pixbuf SVG support..)

Cinnamon Edition
----------------
    nemo-preview doesn't work


MATE Edition
------------
    guest session blocks mintmenu
    mate-panel:
        freezes everytime I try to add or move a launcher (icon) to it.
        when applying a bg color, the “Window List” remains unchanged.
