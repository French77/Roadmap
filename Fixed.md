Cinnamon Edition

wacom rotates with display
touchscreen doesn't rotate with display
crash when using kazam.
After you move the bottom panel to a side, you need to restart Cinnamon because the menu session icons get lost: http://imgur.com/r3gotjal.png
In System settings, when I click on "Input method", the "Language settings" open instead! When clicking on "Input method" in the start menu, it works. Japanese also works fine.
calendar text is too small (it's the same size as before, we made the status applets smaller to compensate)
The notification area icons will look more elegant if is set to 22 px. by default (even so, will be bigger than the defaults on Linux Mint 19.0).
Start menu doesn't auto-shrink â€“ too much space between the lock and favorites button and unused space under "Places".
in settings, "window list" applet (when switched to modern) looks as if it's added and broken.
