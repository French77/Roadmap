	mintsources: warning text uses hardcoded color (looks wrong in mint-y-dark)
	mintsources: can't browse PPA (relies on lsb_release -u)
	mintdrivers: grey font not readable
	mintdrivers https://github.com/linuxmint/mintdrivers/issues/23
	Optimus Graphic: When right clicking on nvidia icon, the menu pops up in the top right
	mintbackup just hangs indefinitely when you try to restore software selection, terminal has no output, and mintbackup is using no cpu.
	add curl to default selection
	In the date/time configuration, trying to change Manual by Synchronisation with NTP server. ntp package is not installed.
	Cant seem to be able to set the clock, unlock the setting and set it but it doesn’t hold.
	mintupload: when editing a (non working – e.g. the default “suggested”) account, without changing something (and therefore closing the window with the top right X) the next time i just get an empty tiny Properties-window! you have close the Upload Manager (just the window – not even necessary to restart mintupload) and it is working again.
	mintlocale: Cannot change default System Locale by Language settings. Thus it can be changed manually by text editor. (file: /etc/default/locale)
	mintlocale: Failed to parse imconfig output
	banshee: will not import media form folders causing hard locks (disabled daap plugin to fix this)
	mintinstall: Missing emus in Software Manager under Games / Emulators: Higan is missing, but in synaptic Dolphin-emu is missing, but in synaptic
	Removed Skype via Software manager but the program still showing up in the Menu. Tried to uninstall it via the Menu but same results. Restarted the system and terminal is no longer works. Skype is still in the Menu but marked as “Install” in Software Manager.
