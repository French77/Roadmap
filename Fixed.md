    mate-panel:
        freezes everytime I try to add or move a launcher (icon) to it.

        indicator-keylock doesn't work properly, always shows whether a lock is enabled or not
        nm-applet (indicators in general) can't be left-clicked
    Battery may be broken notification is annoying.

    mint-y-theme:
        When adding “Workspace Switcher” to panel it displays in blue color and does not follow default theme color green?
        Text in the panel (including window-list and clock applet) seems to be in bold style when it should be normal style?
